Next Steps:

[x] lambda calculus
  = potential improvements
  - [x] let assignment
  - [x] when parsing abstractions, store the bound variable as a string rather than a Var term
        in preparation for parsing multiple variable bindings in a single lambda abstraction.
  - [x] multiple variables binding in one λ abstraction
  - [x] investigate parsing algorithms and choose one that supports left recursion
  - [x] make abstraction right associative so that we don't need parens around abstractions
  - [x] make application left associative so that we don't need parens around applications
  - [ ] can we implement a simple db in the lambda calculus?
